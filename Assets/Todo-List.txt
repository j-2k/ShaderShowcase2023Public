Making a trailer for a game that dosnt exist
God hand final

Cinematics/Art
Cinematic needs to have some sort of replay watching ranger in 3rd person?
solutions could be a replay system with key presses & with a camera follow? might be too much work for something simple consider cinemachine.

===================UNTITLED PROJ===================
Story of the jester & adelaide with a sad tone & setting. music references can be irrepressibles in this shirt.
- jester has a gun + bullets resemble the amount of life left in the jester. Once 0 grim apears & scene freezes.
- final scene to be a bloodbath with only adelaide alive and someone in the crowd.
- grim reaps the soul of jester & dissapears.
